# ScheduleScraper

This is a script I created to scrape my co-workers' calenders for unbooked interview times.
The script then parses this data, formats it into an email or writes to a shared spreadsheet.
The purpose of this app is to increase efficiency within the team and allocate hours to where they are needed most.

***

To start using the schedule scraper, clone down the repo and inside the root of the project:
```
run "npm install"
```
* modify the contents of constants.js to reflect you and the current staff

* change the name of auth.example.js to auth.js and fill in relevent fields
```
run "npm run help" to get started
```
