# ScheduleScraper

This is a script I created to scrape my co-workers' calenders for unbooked interview times.
The script then parses this data, formats it into an email, and sends it to staff.
The purpose of this app is to increase efficiency within the team and allocate hours to where they are needed most.

***

To start using the schedule scraper, clone down the repo and inside the root of the project:
```
run "npm install"
```
* modify the contents of constants.js to reflect you and the current staff

* change the name of auth.example.js to auth.js and fill in relevent fields
```
run "npm run help" to get started
```
